# Medscape Technical Assessment
This coding assignment is designed to give some understanding of my coding proficiency to your team.

## Part One
Created a file in the `src/question-1` directory containing my answers about ```question - 1```. It's wrote with Javascript and fully tested.

#### Question 1
Created functiond that accepts an array, and returns the array in reverse **without using array.reverse** in multiple ways.

Test conditions:
```
source - ['Dog', 'Cat', 'Bear', 'Whale']
return - ['Whale', 'Bear', 'Cat', 'Dog']
```

#### Question 2

Created functions that determines if a string is a palindrome. A palindrome is a word or phrase that is spelled 
the same forwards and reversed.

Test conditions:
```
Radar - returns true
Radars - returns false
Never odd or even - returns true
```

## Part Two
Created simple ``` QUASAR - based ``` `` vue.js `` webapp by following the instructions you mentioned.

- Built a simple page/view that displays a **responsive** list of cat facts, using (or not using) as many components as you'd like
- Used this **endpoint** to complete task in **vuex**: **https://catfact.ninja/facts?**
- Each separate fact returned by the response from the above endpoint should be displayed as a card
  - The cards are displaying on a grid depending on resolution
    - Desktop resolutions: 3x3 grid 
    - Mobile and tablet resolutions: Single column

## Result
Created new simple ``` Quasar app ``` by following the instruction of ** Part 2 **
using https://catfact.ninja/facts? endpoint with ``` limit ``` and ``` page ``` queries to display `` cat data ``depending on queries like ```per page ``` and ``` per limited length ```
